## LibDriver PMSX003

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/pmsx003/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

PMSX003 is a kind of digital and universal particle concentration sensor,which can be used to obtain the number of suspended particles in the air,i.e.the concentration of particles,and output them in the form of digital interface. This sensor can be inserted into variable instruments related to the concentration of suspended particles in the air or other environmental improvement equipments to provide correct concentration data in time.

LibDriver PMSX003 is a full-featured driver of PMSX003 launched by LibDriver.It provides the function of air quality reading and other functions. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver PMSX003 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver PMSX003 UART platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver PMSX003 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver PMSX003 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver PMSX003 offline document.

/datasheet includes PMSX003 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface UART platform independent template and finish your platform UART driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_pmsx003_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;

/* init */
res = pmsx003_basic_init();

    /* read data */
    res = pmsx003_basic_read(&data);
