Data Bits : 8.

Stop Bits: 1.

Parity: None.

Flow Control: None.

#### 2.3 Serial Port Assistant

We use '\n' to wrap lines.If your serial port assistant displays exceptions (e.g. the displayed content does not divide lines), please modify the configuration of your serial port assistant or replace one that supports '\n' parsing.
